# stock-dashboard
Stock dashboard with callback feature.

Please ensure you have all required dependencies before running the script. Ideally, install all dependencies using a virtual environment - this can be done using virtualenv or pipenv ideally.

This script generates a dashboard that's locally hosted - in order to access this dashboard you must navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ after the file runs.

There are two text fields on the dashboard. One is used to enter the ticker for the stock you want and will change the top subfigure. The second field is used to enter the trends URL and will change the bottom figure.
